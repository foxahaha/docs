### Important Note

:::danger

Depending on your firewall settings, itâ€™s possible that a connection is established, but the internet does not work, or it does not work specifically through the **VPN**. 

To resolve this, locate the application icon in the system tray (bottom right corner near the clock), right-click on it, and select: `Operating Mode` > `VPN (Experimental)` or `VPN Service (Experimental)`.
